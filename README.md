Steps to import the project into IDE for further development.
	1) Create a local directory and run `git init` in that directory.
	2) Create clone of the git repository in same directory. We will use ssh to communicate with codehub.
	   Create public key from your home directory and add the ssh key to your profile settings on codehub.
	   Note: steps 1 and 2 may be avoided if you already have an existing workspace and can clone the sitecore project into the same workspace directory.
	3) Now clone the repo using.
	   git clone git@codehub.esri.com:IST-QA/sitecore-projects.git
	4) Import the gradle prject in the IDE of your choice.
	5) Create a branch and make changes to the code after checking out the new branch. Push the changes to the remote branch and raise a pull request for it to be reviewed and merged to development branch.
